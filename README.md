## Design Notes

Rebuilt website with HTML and CSS, responsive design beginning with mobile first, through tablet (min-width: 840px) and desktop.

The original font used on this site is Helvetica Neue. However, this font is not supported universally. Although it works on Mac and most browsers, users are encountering problems on Windows machines. I decided to opt for the more universally supported font: Roboto. More info here: 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/13823'

Although it was my original aim to use CSS grid to build the site, I decided against it as it was overcomplicating matters, and flexbox was more than suitable for my aims.

The dropdown menus on the navs I have left for now, as these require javascript to function.

## Dev Notes

Made predominantly with CSS flexbox, mobile first and using flexbox container and items to scale from tablet size to desktop. Navbar and footer made with CSS flexbox.
